every function is component in react. To create a component you have to follow these two things:

### Interview questions on react
```bash
1. What is the difference between state and props?
2. How react works?
```
### What is react?
```bash
1. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. React is declarative, which means that it describes the UI as a tree of nested elements, rather than as a sequence of instructions.
3. React is component-based, which means that the UI is built using components.

```
### Declarative
```bash
1. React is declarative.
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
```
### Component-based
```bash
1. React is component-based.
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
