every function is component in react. To create a component you have to follow these two things:

### Interview questions on react
```bash
1. What is the difference between state and props?
2. How react works?
```
### What is react?
```bash
1. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. React is declarative, which means that it describes the UI as a tree of nested elements, rather than as a sequence of instructions.
3. React is component-based, which means that the UI is built using components.

```
### Declarative
```bash
1. React is declarative.
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
```
### Component-based
```bash
1. React is component-based.
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
```

### Library vs framework
```bash
1. Library is like a shop with same things. And library is a shopping mall with many single shop.
2. Library is small than framework. And there is no restriction on using other things in a library. But a framework may have some restrictions on some things. Like if you use router in an angular project, you have to must use the router of the angular.
```

### Why you will use props?
```bash
1. we will use props to pass data to components
```

### Why you will use useState?
```bash
1. we will use useState to change data from one state to another
```

### How react work?
```bash
React works on the basis of three things-
1. virtual DOM- at first react create a virtual DOM of the whole page.
2. diff algorithm- it compare the virtual DOM with the real DOM.
3. real DOM- it replace the virtual DOM with the real DOM.
4. then the real DOM will be rendered to the screen.
```
